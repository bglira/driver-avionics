# socket-arinc429
Socket based ARINC-429 Driver for Linux similar to SocketCAN

This is based on work done by Marek Vasut [submitted in this mailing list posting](https://www.mail-archive.com/netdev@vger.kernel.org/msg85466.html). It looks like this was never brought into the Kernel because there were multiple follow-up ideas about merging it with SocketCAN, which is a really good idea but is outside the sciope of our requirements for this driver.
